# Maptile Geography: pt_mun, v.0.1
--------------------------------

Mainland Portuguese municipalities for Stata's [maptile](https://michaelstepner.com/maptile/) package, written by [Michael Stepner](https://github.com/michaelstepner/maptile). Maptile provides a simple method to map a variable in Stata. 

## How to install it?
First, if you haven't done it aleady, install maptile and spmap:
`ssc install maptile`
`ssc intall spmap`

For now, the only option to install this geography is manually. 
Download the zip file with the source folders and save it in PERSONAL/maptile_geographies, which is where maptile loads geographies automatically.

## Using the geography

    1. Choose your dataset wisely. Ensure it is at the municipality level, identified by official 4-digit DICO municipality codes for mainland Portugal. (There is a toy dataset in the folder.)
    
    2. Choose the variable you want to map. 

    3. Run maptile and specify the geography name (pt_mun):
    `maptile [varname], geo(pt_mun)`
    
    4. To see the geography's help file, use: 
    `maptile_geohelp pt_mun`

## For the replication files

There are two ways to run the code that builds this maptile geo template:

1. Build using -project-

- Install the project command using `ssc install project`.
- Then run `project, setup` and choose the do-file that begins with "build_".
- Then run `project build_<geoname>, build`.

2. Build interactively

- Open the do-file that begins with "build_"
- Edit the line that reads `global root "/Users/Gon√ßalo/Documents/GitHub/maptile_pt_mun/geo_pt_mun_creation"`.  Replace the folder in that line with the folder on your computer that contains this do-file.
- Run this do-file.

All templates based on the amazing work of Michael Stepner, stepner@mit.edu.
